Would like the below, but it doesn't work

Allow group acquire_identity_group to read buckets in compartment biosimspace_root where target.bucket.name='acquire_identity'
Allow group acquire_identity_group to manage objects in compartment biosimspace_root where all {target.bucket.name='acquire_identity', any {request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE', request.permission='OBJECT_INSPECT'}}

Actually now using

Allow group acquire_identity_group to manage all-resources in compartment biosimspace_root
